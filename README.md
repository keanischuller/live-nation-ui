# Live Nation Application UI
User Interfacing for a ticketmaster/live-nation style application.

**The user interfacing was created on Figma which can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/5oAkoB4gOaqZIPPo4cjF8v/Live-Nation-Mock-Up?node-id=1-2&node-type=canvas&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1)**


**Buying Resell Tickets UI Design Features**

After opening and logging into the application, the home page allows users to filter events by category or select one of the trending events. ​
This allows users to easily access popular events they may be interested in and can be tailored to user preferences the more they use the application through a more robust recommendation system in the back-end.​
Users can also search for their event of choice using the search feature. This will allow users to find events quickly, ensure there is little time wasted manually searching through the events.​
Once an event is selected, if the platform still has resell tickets available for sale, the user can select their seating of choice and how many tickets to buy. The user can select up to 4 seats. This feature includes an interactive map of the stadium and a layout of the stage to ensure seat selection ease.​
The user lastly buys the tickets from the platform and receives a confirmation of purchase and their digital ticket via email.


**Waitlist UI Design Features​**

An alternative situation to buying resell tickets that are still available, some users may want to buy last minute tickets and find that all the tickets are sold out. In this situation, users can put themselves on a waiting list for the unused seats of those who do not show up to the event. ​
The application will display that the show is completely sold out. In that situation, the user selects to be put on the waitlist.​
The button is on the same page to streamline the sign-up process and ensure proper exposure to all users. ​
Once the user chooses to put themselves on the waitlist, they can select their preferred seating using the interactive map. ​
The user then inputs the email they'd like to put on the waitlist. This allows the user's contact information to be reliable and up to date, ensuring the user gets properly notified. The user will also get a pop-up notification on their phone directly from the application.​
Lastly, the user must put down a deposit to reserve their place in the waitlist, which can be done using the same check-out as that to buy tickets. They will similarly get payment confirmation and details.


**Waitlist Removal and Refund UI Design Features​**

A user may want to remove themselves off the waitlist. This can be achieved by firstly going into the user's tickets page, where they'll find all the ticket's they've bought for upcoming events. ​
This gives the user a comprehensive location to find all their tickets for easy ticket management.​
The user can then select the event of choice to view the details of their ticket. ​
Since the user currently is on the waitlist for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, the user can view their waitlist details. They can then choose to remove themselves off the waitlist. The button is directly on the page to ensure that it is easy to find and that all the actions for an event are in the same place.​
Once clicked, a pop-up will come up asking the user if they're sure of their choice. This gives the user a second chance to change their mind, and mitigate the risk of any misclicks.​
Lastly, once the user choose to remove themselves, a refund will be issued and the refund details will be provided. This ensure that the user knows they've been successfully removed from the waitlist.
